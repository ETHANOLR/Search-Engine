Create index: in if __name__ == "__main__": at the bottom, change the base to where you store the DEV(cralwed pages). Make sure you have the subindex directory because we save the sub index in it and merge later. run the indexCreation.py.

Terminal search: after you create the index, run the Retrive.py and after 5 - 10seconds, entry a query will be there. Enter "quit" or nothing to quit the query search. we default the number of result to 100.(you can change it in line 197)

Interface search: after you create the index, run the Interface.py and after 5 - 10seconds, the interface will pop up. You put your question in the box and the number of results you want. Click "search" and result will be there. Click "close" to quit the interface.
